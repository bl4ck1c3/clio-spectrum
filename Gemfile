# FIXED:  Can't move up to 4.0 series yet - blacklight_range_limit has dependency on 3
# but, devise_wind still has Rails 3.2 dependencies.

gem 'rails', '~> 4.1.0'

# `attr_accessible` is extracted out of Rails into a gem. Please use new 
# recommended protection model for params(strong_parameters) or add 
# `protected_attributes` to your Gemfile to use old one. 
# Oops, Blacklight has "logic that assumes protected_attributes is Rails 3 only" 
#   see:  https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/issues/906
# Does this mean that including this gem breaks things?
# gem 'protected_attributes'
# Yes, it does, we get the behavior explained in issue 906.
# OK, bite the bullet and convert to strong_parameters everywhere.

# `ActiveRecord::SessionStore` is extracted out of Rails into a gem. 
# Please add `activerecord-session_store` to your Gemfile to use it.
